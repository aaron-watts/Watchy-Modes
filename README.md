# Watchy-Modes

Mode based system for Watchy, seperating tasks into seperate modes - each with their own screens.

### Modes

- Analog (Gabel)
- Digital (Time and Date)
- Step Counter

### Based on [Brainwork-for-Watchy](https://github.com/BraininaBowl/Brainwork-for-Watchy) by BraininaBowl:

- Light/Dark theme switch removed (Light themes only)
- Uses battery from [Bahn](https://github.com/BraininaBowl/Bahn-for-Watchy) watchface by BraininaBowl on all modes except Analog
- Consistent battery indicator design and placement throughout digital modes
- NotoSans fonts and Material icons used in digitial modes for clean UI

### Includes modified version of [Analog](https://github.com/BenjaminGabel/AnalogWatchFace) V2 Watchface by BenjaminGabel:

- Colours inverted to light theme
- Date panels removed
- _Gabel_ text changed to _Watchy_

#### Note:

Instructions from [Brainwork-for-Watchy](https://github.com/BraininaBowl/Brainwork-for-Watchy) were not required for me as Watchy.h version I am using already had `virtual void` functions, consult Brainwork README for help.
